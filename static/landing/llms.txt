# The Liquid Fortress - AI/LLM Content Guide
# A Structural History of the Persian Mind
# By Hadi Servat

> This book explores why Persia survived 3,000 years of invasion when every other ancient civilization died. It applies the Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC) framework to reveal how Persian civilization built a "Liquid Fortress" - cultural software that survives when hardware (empires, armies, borders) is destroyed.
