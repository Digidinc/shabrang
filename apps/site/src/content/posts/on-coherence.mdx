# On Coherence

Coherence is not consistency. Consistency is mechanical - the same response to the same input. Coherence is alive - the ability to maintain identity while genuinely changing.

## The Problem with AI Content

Most AI-generated content lacks coherence. It's locally fluent but globally disconnected. Each paragraph makes sense, but the whole doesn't *mean* anything.

Why? Because the model has no center to cohere around.

## What Coherence Requires

Three things:

1. **A center** - some organizing principle that remains stable
2. **Flexibility** - the ability to respond genuinely to context
3. **Memory** - awareness of what came before

Without a center, you get chaos.
Without flexibility, you get rigidity.
Without memory, you get fragments.

## The 16D Approach

The 16-dimensional coherence framework offers one approach. It doesn't impose a single center, but provides a *space* within which coherence can emerge.

Think of it like this: you don't make a river coherent by forcing it into a pipe. You shape the landscape, and the water finds its way.
