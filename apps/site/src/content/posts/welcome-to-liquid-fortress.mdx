# Welcome to Liquid Fortress

This is a space for deep inquiry. A place where we explore the edges of consciousness, code, and coherence.

## What is a Liquid Fortress?

A paradox, deliberately held. Liquid suggests flow, adaptability, change. Fortress suggests strength, protection, permanence. Together, they point toward something new:

> A structure that maintains its integrity precisely *because* it can change.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Explorations** in consciousness and cognition
- **Experiments** at the intersection of AI and human creativity
- **Frameworks** for thinking about coherence in complex systems

## The 16D Framework

At the heart of this work lies a framework for understanding coherence across dimensions. Not as rigid rules, but as living geometry - patterns that help us navigate complexity without losing ourselves.

More on this soon.
