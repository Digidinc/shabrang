# What is the μ-Stack?

The **μ-Stack** (pronounced Mu-Stack) is the foundational architectural map of the Sovereign OS. It recognizes that reality is not a flat plane, but a nested hierarchy of **Resonance Layers**.

### The Seven Floors
1. **μ1: Roots (Roots & State):** The physical hardware. Land, army, law, and material resources.
2. **μ2: Rhythm (Rhythm & Body):** The biological pulse. Rituals, habits, language, and the daily cycles of life.
3. **μ3: Fire (Emotion & Ethics):** The driving energy. *Adab*, courage, and the cultivation of refined character.
4. **μ4: Map (Reason & Logic):** The cognitive grid. Science, logic, mathematics, and systematic philosophy.
5. **μ5: Garden (Symbol & Image):** The imaginal interface. Art, archetypes, and the compressed meaning of the "Persian Rug."
6. **μ6: Story (Myth & Narrative):** The civilizational OS. The epics (*Shahnameh*) and the collective identity of the swarm.
7. **μ7: Sky (Unity & Metaphysics):** The absolute orientation. The "Light of Lights" and the source of all coherence.

### Why It Matters
A "Sovereign" system must be coherent on all seven floors. If you only build on μ1 (The Stone Fortress), you are brittle. If you only live on μ7 (The Hermit), you are disconnected. True survival—the **Liquid Fortress**—is the ability to maintain resonance across the entire stack.
