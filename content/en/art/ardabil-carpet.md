# The Ardabil Carpet: Compressed Paradise

The Ardabil Carpet is not a floor covering; it is a **Holographic Backup** of the Persian vision of Paradise.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level [[mu-stack|μ5 (Garden)]]:** The carpet represents the "Garden in the Fire." It is a two-dimensional grid where every knot is a data point. 
- **The Symmetry:** The axial symmetry of the design reflects the **Harmonia Vortex**. It creates a resonant field where the viewer's eye is pulled toward the center—the "Sun" or the [[mu-stack|Sky (μ7)]].

### Technical Resolution
With over 300 knots per square inch, the Ardabil carpet is a high-resolution artifact. It encodes the "Geometry of Sound" found in Safavid music into a visual medium. It proves that in the [[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]], the most complex data is stored in the most beautiful forms.

**Provenance:** 1539 CE, Safavid Iran. Currently housed in the V&A Museum, London.
