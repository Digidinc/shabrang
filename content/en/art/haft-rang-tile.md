# The Haft-Rang Tile: The Field Pixel

The *Haft-Rang* (Seven-Color) tile is the basic unit—the "Pixel"—of the Persian architectural field.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ2 (Rhythm):** The tile is an artifact of **Visual Rhythm**. Through the repetition of a single unit, a massive, coherent field of color and geometry is created. 
- **The Garden (μ5):** When thousands of tiles are combined, they create the "Imaginal Garden." The tile is the bridge between the material clay (μ1) and the symbolic vision (μ5).

### Iterative Geometry
Each tile contains a fragment of a larger geometric pattern. In FRC terms, this is **Modular Coherence**. Even if one "Pixel" is damaged, the overall pattern remains recognizable. It is a resilient way to store beauty in the physical world.

**Provenance:** Safavid Iran (peak development in the 17th Century).
