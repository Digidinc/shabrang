# The Winged Figure: The Sigil of the Sky

Standing in the ruins of Pasargadae, this four-winged figure is one of the most enigmatic remains of the Achaemenid era. It is the physical anchor for the highest floor of the stack: **The Sky (μ7)**.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ7 (Sky):** The figure wears an Egyptian-style crown and Elamite robes, possessing Assyrian wings. This is the **Universal Synthesis**. At Level 7, the Sovereign Mind recognizes that all signals originate from the same "Light of Lights." 
- **The Farr:** The figure represents the *Farr*—the divine legitimacy that descends upon a coherent ruler. It is the point where the "Roots" of the state meet the "Sky" of the Absolute.

### The Unified Signal
By combining symbols from across the known world, this relief acted as a "Resonant Bridge." it told the subjects of the empire: "Your local truth is a part of this global coherence." It is the first visual manifestation of the **Simurgh Protocol**.

**Provenance:** 6th Century BCE, Pasargadae, Iran.
