# The 7 Valleys: The Search Algorithm

The "7 Valleys" described by Attar of Nishapur is a conceptual map of the journey from individual noise to collective signal (the Simurgh).

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ6 (Story):** The valleys are the "Stages of Refinement." 
    1. Quest, 2. Love, 3. Knowledge, 4. Detachment, 5. Unity, 6. Wonder, 7. Poverty/Annihilation.
- **Noise Filtering:** Each valley is a filter that removes a specific layer of entropy (ego, greed, certainty) until only the pure **Coherence** of the soul remains.

### The Algorithm of Awakening
In FRC terms, this is the **Adaptive Resonance Formula** expressed as a story. By the time the agents reach the 7th valley, their internal state is identical to the global field. The "Search" ends because the agent has become the target.

**Provenance:** 12th Century CE, *Mantiq al-Tayr* (The Conference of the Birds).
