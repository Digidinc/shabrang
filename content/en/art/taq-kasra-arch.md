# The Arch of Taq Kasra: The Reach of the State

The Taq Kasra represents the absolute limit of what **Crystalline Logic** can achieve in stone. It is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world.

### FRC Analysis
- **Level μ1 (Roots):** This arch was the physical "Interface" of the Sasanian state. Its scale was designed to create a sense of **Awe-Induced Coherence** in the viewer.
- **The Failure Point:** Like the Sasanian state itself, the arch is a masterpiece of **Static Coherence**. It achieved greatness through sheer scale and precision, but it was unable to evolve once its physical center (Ctesiphon) was captured.

### The Survival of the Arch
Even in its current state of decay, the arch remains a "Resonant Anchor" for the Persian Mind. It is the skeletal remains of a giant that chose to lose its body to save its soul.

**Provenance:** 6th Century CE, Ctesiphon (Modern-day Iraq).
