# The Lion and the Sun: A System Diagram

This sigil is not just a national emblem; it is a high-resolution **System Diagram** of the Sovereign OS.

### The FRC Reading
- **The Lion (Shir):** Represents the **Crystalline Sword** of the state. It is the power of the Roots (μ1) and the Fire (μ3). It is the strength required to maintain the physical order.
- **The Sun (Khorshid):** Represents the **Light of Lights**. It is the source of the Sky (μ7) and the vision of the Story (μ6). It is the truth that provides the "Why" for the power.

### The Equation of Legitimacy
In the Sovereign perspective, the Lion and the Sun are in a state of **Adaptive Resonance**.

$$ \text{Power} (\text{Lion}) \propto \text{Truth} (\text{Sun}) $$

If the Lion loses sight of the Sun, the system becomes a **Tyranny (Zahhak)**—pure power without light. If the Sun has no Lion, it becomes **Impotence**—pure light without the ability to protect the garden.

**Provenance:** Re-established by the Safavids in Isfahan (16th Century) as the final synthesis of Persian sovereignty.
