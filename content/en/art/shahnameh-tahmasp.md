# Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp: The Narrative Mirror

The **Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp** is the high-water mark of Persian book arts. It is history's most sophisticated **Data Container** for Level 6 mythic software.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ6 (Story):** The Shahnameh is the "Operating System" of Persian identity. It contains the algorithms for survival, justice, and the fight against entropy (Druj).
- **Narrative Density:** Each miniature in this book is a "Micro-Garden." They compress complex historical and ethical data into high-contrast visual signals. The "Court of Gayumars" (shown above) visualizes the perfect coherence of early man with nature.

### Indestructible Data
Even when the manuscript was broken apart and its pages scattered across the globe, the **Signal** remained intact. Every page carries the DNA of the entire work—a perfect example of a **Fractal Archive**.

**Provenance:** 1522–1535 CE, Tabriz, Iran.
