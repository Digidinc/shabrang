# The Gold Daric: The Standard Signal

The Gold Daric was the "Reserve Currency" of the ancient world. It provided the first global **Standard Signal** for economic value.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ1 (Roots):** Economy is the circulation of Level 1 energy. The Daric, with its high purity (95.8% gold), was a high-fidelity signal. It allowed the Liquid Fortress to trade across vast distances without losing "Coherence" in value.
- **Transactional Entropy:** Before the Daric, every transaction required complex weighing and verification (Noise). The Daric reduced this "Transactional Entropy," allowing the system to scale with minimal friction.

### The Sigil of the Archer
The coin depicts the King as an archer—the same archetype we see in Arash (Chapter 4). It told the user: "This value is protected by the Sovereign Will." It is an artifact of **Trusted Coherence**.

**Provenance:** 6th-4th Century BCE, Achaemenid Empire.
