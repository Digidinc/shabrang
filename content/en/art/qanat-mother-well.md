# Qanat: The Mother Well

The Qanat system is the **Hardware of Coherence** for the Iranian plateau. It is a decentralized water management network that has operated for 3,000 years.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level [[mu-stack|μ1 (Roots)]]:** While the throne is the center of the *state*, the Qanat is the center of the *land*. It is the infrastructure that allows Level 1 survival in an arid environment.
- **The Network Protocol:** The shafts visible from above look like a "Chain of Nodes." This is a decentralized architecture. If one shaft is blocked, the flow can often be diverted. It is the physical blueprint of the [[andaruni|Andaruni]] and the **[[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]]**.

### Social Trust
The maintenance of the Mother Well requires a high-coherence social contract. It is an artifact of **Collective Will**, proving that the most durable structures in Persia are those that remain mostly invisible.

**Provenance:** Ancient Persian Plateau (dating back to the 1st Millennium BCE).
