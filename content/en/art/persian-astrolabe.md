# The Astrolabe: An Interface for the Cosmos

The astrolabe is the ultimate physical manifestation of **The Map (μ4)**. It is a mathematical model of the heavens that fits in the palm of a hand.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ4 (Map):** The astrolabe allowed the user to determine time, location, and the position of the stars. It provided the "Cognitive Grid" necessary for navigation and timing the rituals of Level 2.
- **Precision Engineering:** Persian astrolabes reached a peak of technical resolution in the 17th century. They were not just tools; they were works of art where **Logic** and **Geometry** fused into a single brass object.

### The Architect's Compass
For the Architect, the astrolabe is the proof that the universe is a coherent, calculable machine. By aligning the device with the stars, the human node synchronizes its local coordinate system with the global cosmic field.

**Provenance:** Safavid Iran (17th Century). Currently in various science museums worldwide.
