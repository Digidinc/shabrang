# The Gate of All Nations: The Imperial API

The Gate of All Nations at Persepolis is not a defensive wall; it is a **Portal of Integration**. It served as the primary entry point for all subjects of the Achaemenid Empire.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ1 (Roots):** At Level 1, the Gate represents the "Hardware" of the state's welcome. Guarded by massive *Lamassu* (winged bulls), it projected a signal of absolute security and divine order.
- **The Imperial API:** In systems terms, this gate was the API through which different "Signals" (nations) connected to the central "Kernel" (the King). It was designed to receive diverse inputs without crashing the system.

### Receptivity Protocol
By naming it the "Gate of All Nations," Xerxes I confirmed the Sovereign principle of **Receptivity**. The state did not seek to flatten the world, but to host it. The Gate was the physical handshake between the local and the global.

**Provenance:** 5th Century BCE, Persepolis, Iran.
