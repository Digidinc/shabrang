# The Rubaiyat: A Map of Transient Logic

The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a "Software Archive" that stores the logic of how to live in a world governed by entropy.

### FRC Analysis
- **Level μ4 (Map):** Khayyam uses the four-line verse (Rubai) as a logical unit. Each poem is an "Observation" from the edge of the world.
- **The Equation of the Now:** Khayyam's logic is built on the **Now-Zero Paradox**. Since the past is gone and the future is unknown, only the current moment has a coherence value ($C > 0$).

### Geometric Poetry
As a mathematician, Khayyam's poetry mirrors his work on cubic equations. It is an artifact of **Precision Awareness**, intended to strip away the "Noise" of religious dogma to find the "Signal" of direct existence.

**Provenance:** 11th Century CE. Various illuminated copies exist globally.
