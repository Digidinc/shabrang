# The Peacock Throne: The Seat of the Sun

The Peacock Throne (*Takht-e Tavoos*) is the ultimate Level 1 interface for centralized power. It is designed to radiate the **Farr** (Divine Glory) through material splendor.

### FRC Analysis
- **Level μ1 (Roots):** The throne serves as the "Primary Key" of the state's physical database. It is where the abstract law of the state meets the tangible body of the King.
- **The Visual Signal:** Covered in thousands of precious stones, it acts as a "Light Scatterer," reflecting the Sun (μ7) into the eyes of the court. It is a tool for **Awe-Induced Phase-Locking**.

### The Flow of Wealth
The throne’s journey from Delhi to Tehran represents the transfer of "Resource Coherence" between empires. It is a nomadic artifact that carries the weight of history in its gold and jewels.

**Provenance:** Originally Mughal (17th Century), captured and redesigned by the Persian Qajar dynasty. Currently in the Treasury of National Jewels, Tehran.
