# The Turquoise Dome: The Geometric Lens

The **Turquoise Dome** of Isfahan is the visual anchor for the **Garden (μ5)** layer. It is a masterpiece of sacred geometry and acoustic engineering.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ7 (Sky):** The dome is a mathematical model of the celestial vault. The turquoise color is chosen to match the sky at dusk—the moment of **Phase Transition** between day and night.
- **The Aperture:** Most Persian domes have a central aperture or a "Sunburst" pattern at the apex. This is the **Input/Output Port** for the Light of Lights. It confirms that the system is open to the absolute.

### Architectural Resonance
The hollow interior of the dome creates a unique acoustic field. When a sound is made at the center, it resonates with perfect clarity. This is the **Acoustic Signature of Coherence**. The dome is not a roof; it is an instrument.

**Provenance:** 17th Century CE, Isfahan, Iran.
