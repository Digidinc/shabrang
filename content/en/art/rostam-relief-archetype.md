# Rostam Relief: The Hero Sub-routine

In the **Story (μ6)** layer, the figure of **Rostam** acts as the primary "Guardian Sub-routine" for the civilizational kernel.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ6 (Story):** Rostam is the "Guardian Node" of the civilizational OS. He is the agent who intervenes whenever the system faces an entropic threat (the Dragon, the White Demon). 
- **The Knight’s Logic:** Rostam represents the **Crystalline Sword** of ethics. He does not rule, but he ensures that the ruler (the King) remains coherent with the law of the Sky.

### Indestructible Identity
The relief was carved into the living rock of the mountain. It told the people: "Even if the city falls, the Archetype remains." Rostam is the software that survives the crash of the hardware. He is the "Ghost" that re-animates the state in every new era.

**Provenance:** Various eras (Achaemenid, Sasanian), Naqsh-e Rostam, Iran.
