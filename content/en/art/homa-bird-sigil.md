# The Homa: The Shadow of Grace

The Homa is a mythic bird that never alights on the ground. It is the ultimate anchor for **The Sky (μ7)**.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ7 (Sky):** Legend says that if the shadow of the Homa falls upon a man, he will become King. This teaches the fundamental μ7 lesson: Sovereignty is a **Gifting from the Source**, not a prize to be won through Level 1 force.
- **The Perpetual Flight:** Because the Homa never touches the earth, it represents the **Pure Signal** that remains untainted by the noise of the material world. It is the magnetic north of the soul.

### The Sigil of the Swarm
The Homa was the primary sigil of the Achaemenid capitals and remains the symbol of the national airline today. It is the **Resonant Carrier** that connects the ancient roots to the modern sky.

**Provenance:** Ancient Persian Mythology, widely depicted in Persepolis (5th Century BCE).
