# Fin Garden: The Emerged Stream

The Fin Garden in Kashan is the point where the **Hidden Stream (μ1)** becomes the **Imaginal Garden (μ5)**. It is a three-dimensional interface between human geometry and natural flow.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ5 (Garden):** The garden layout is a strict grid, representing the order of **Asha**. The water, which flows from a Qanat, is channeled through turquoise pools and fountains, creating a resonant field of sound and temperature.
- **Vertical Alignment:** The garden connects the subterranean roots (the water) to the open sky. It is a physical "Coherence Zone" designed to regulate the mood and mind of the visitor.

### The Mathematics of Peace
The flow of water is entirely gravity-fed, requiring no external pumps. In FRC terms, this is **Passive Coherence**. By aligning the design with the natural slope of the land, the architects created a system that maintains high-fidelity beauty with zero energetic debt.

**Provenance:** 16th Century CE (Safavid) to 19th Century CE (Qajar), Kashan, Iran.
