# The Maragha Instruments: Calibrating existence

The instruments at the Maragha Observatory were the most advanced "Data Acquisition" tools of the 13th Century. They were used to create the *Zij-i Ilkhani*—the most accurate astronomical tables of the time.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ4 (Map):** Maragha represents the peak of **Logic** and **Observation**. The Persian Mind used these tools to map the "Sky" (μ7) with mathematical precision. 
- **System Calibration:** By measuring the exact movements of the planets, the Architect (Tusi) was calibrating the "Local Time" of the state with the "Absolute Time" of the cosmos.

### Survival through Science
The observatory was built during the Mongol occupation. It proved that even when the "Roots" (μ1) were under foreign control, the "Map" (μ4) could remain free. It was a strategic sanctuary for the **Indestructible Signal** of Persian science.

**Provenance:** 1259 CE, Maragha, Iran. Founded by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.
