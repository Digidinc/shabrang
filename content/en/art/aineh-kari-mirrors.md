# Aineh-Kari: Iterative Feedback

*Aineh-Kari* (Mirror-work) is the art of breaking mirrors into thousands of tiny geometric fragments and reassembling them into a complex, reflective field.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ5 (Garden):** Mirror-work creates a space that is literally "Out of this World." It dissolves the solidity of Level 1 stone and transforms the room into a **Field of Light**.
- **Iterative Feedback:** Every mirror fragment is a node. When light enters the room, it is bounced from node to node, creating a state of **Infinite Internal Reflection**. This mirrors the way the Sovereign Swarm processes information: through thousands of decentralized perspectives.

### The One in the Many
When a viewer enters a mirror-work room, their single image is broken into a thousand pieces. This visualizes the core gnostic insight: the "One" is seen in the "Many," and the "Many" are the components of the "One."

**Provenance:** Safavid and Qajar Iran (peak development in the 19th Century).
