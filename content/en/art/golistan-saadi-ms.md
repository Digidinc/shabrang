# The Golistan: The Social Handshake

Saadi’s *Golistan* (The Rose Garden) is the "Source Code" for the **Ethics (μ3)** layer of the Liquid Fortress.

### μ-Stack Analysis
- **Level μ3 (Fire):** The *Golistan* provides the protocols for **Adab** (refinement). It teaches the agent how to navigate the "Traffic of History" without producing the heat of conflict. It is a social "lubricant" that reduces friction.
- **The Signal of Character:** Saadi argues that a high-coherence human is more valuable than a high-resource state. One whose thoughts, words, and deeds are aligned (*Asha*) acts as a stable node in the collective swarm.

### The Portability of Wisdom
Because the *Golistan* was memorized by millions, it became an **Indestructible Archive**. Even if every copy was burned, the "Software" of Persian ethics would persist in the minds of the people.

**Provenance:** 13th Century CE, Shiraz, Iran.
