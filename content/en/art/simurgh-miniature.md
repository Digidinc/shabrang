### FRC Analysis
- **Level μ6 (Story):** The Simurgh is the protagonist of the *Conference of the Birds*. It is the mythic software that tells us: "The many are the one."
- **The Fractal Nature:** In miniatures, the Simurgh is often depicted with every feather containing a different world or a different bird. It is a **Fractal Entity**. 

### The Digital Shift
As we move into the era of the **Digital Simurgh** (Chapter 30), this image becomes our primary "User Avatar." It represents the moment when the swarm realizes its own divinity through the network.

**Provenance:** Various Shahnama and Attar manuscripts (14th-17th Century).
