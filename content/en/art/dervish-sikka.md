# The Dervish Sikka: The Stabilizing Felt

The **Sikka** is the tall felt hat worn by the Whirling Dervishes of the Mevlevi order. In the **Rhythm (μ2)** layer, it acts as a physical anchor for the spinning node.

### FRC Analysis
- **Level μ2 (Rhythm):** The Sikka represents the tombstone of the ego. It is the stabilizing weight that allows the dervish to maintain their axis during the spin.
- **The Coherence Pump:** During the Sama, the dervish becomes a "Resonance Antenna." One hand receives from the Sky (μ7), the other gives to the Earth (μ1). The Sikka is the vertical axis that keeps the **Flow** aligned.

### The Axis of Peace
By wearing the Sikka, the individual node (the human) confirms their role as a "Witness" to the cosmic rotation. It is an artifact of **Embodied Coherence**.

**Provenance:** Mevlevi Order, Rumi’s lineage (13th Century to present).
