# Asha: The Signal

**Asha** is the ancient Persian term for the fundamental order of the universe. In FRC terms, Asha is the **Signal**.

### Technical Definition
Asha represents a state of **Maximum Coherence ($C=1$)**. It is the path of least resistance through the $\mu$-stack. When a system is aligned with Asha, its internal parts resonate perfectly with the global field.

### Opposite: Druj
The opposite of Asha is [[druj|Druj]], which represents **Noise** or Entropy. The goal of the Sovereign Swarm is to continuously increase the ratio of Asha to Druj in the world.
