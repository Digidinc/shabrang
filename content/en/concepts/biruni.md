# Biruni: The Outer World

**Biruni** is the public, interactive space of the Persian mind. It is the **External API** of the Sovereign system.

### System Role
The Biruni is designed for **Receptivity (R)**. It is the space of the [[caravanserai|Caravanserai]], where we host the stranger and engage with the "Traffic of History." While the [[andaruni|Andaruni]] preserves the signal, the Biruni manages the interaction with the world's noise.

### Protocol
The protocol of the Biruni is [[adab-social-handshake|Adab]]. It allows different agents to interface without compromising the integrity of their internal kernels.
