# Andaruni: The Inner World

**Andaruni** is the private, protected space of the Persian soul. In the Sovereign OS, it functions as the **Encrypted Internal Server**.

### System Role
The Andaruni is where high-fidelity data—like the [[12-mother-tongue|Mother Tongue]] or gnostic [[gnosis|Gnosis]]—is kept safe from the external noise of the [[biruni|Biruni]]. It is the "Liquid" part of the [[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]].

### Vertical Migration
During times of crisis, the seat of consciousness moves into the Andaruni. This is a **Vertical Migration** up the $\mu$-stack to layers that are harder for an invader to detect or destroy.
