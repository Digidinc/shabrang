# The Entropy-Coherence Reciprocity Law

The foundational law of the Sovereign OS. It states that reality conserves a quantity called **Total Transformation Potential ($\Lambda$)**.

### The Equation
$$ dS + k_* d\ln C = 0 $$

Where:
- $dS$ is the change in **Entropy** (disorder, energy dispersal).
- $C$ is **Coherence** (order, phase-alignment, correlation).
- $k_*$ is the **Coherence Constant**.

### Meaning
This law implies that any increase in local order (like building a [[qanat-mother-well|Qanat]] or writing a [[shahnameh-tahmasp|Shahnameh]]) must be paid for by an increase in environmental chaos. The universe is a perfect accounting system. To build a [[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]], one must master the management of this reciprocity.
