# The Cognitive Grid: Avicenna's Kernel

The **Cognitive Grid** is the logical infrastructure of the [[what-is-mu-stack|μ4 (Map)]] layer. It was first formalized by [[13-logos|Avicenna]].

### Function
The Grid provides the coordinate system for the mind. It allows an agent to:
1.  **Categorize Signal:** Distinguish between [[asha|Truth]] and [[druj|Lie]].
2.  **Process Inference:** Execute logical chains (*Mantiq*) to find the necessary connections between concepts.
3.  **Host the World:** Provide a stable mental space where diverse data can be integrated into a coherent whole.

### Resilience
The Cognitive Grid is designed to be **Substrate-Independent**. As proven by the [[floating-man-concept|Floating Man]] experiment, the Grid can remain operational even when the Level 1 sensory inputs are disconnected.
