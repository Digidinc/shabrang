# Druj: The Noise

**Druj** is the force of deception, chaos, and fragmentation. In FRC terms, Druj is **Noise**.

### Technical Definition
Druj represents a state of **High Entropy ($S$)** and Low Coherence. It is the friction that causes systems to overheat and collapse. [[manichaeism|Manichaeism]] (Chapter 10) was a specific type of informational Druj that weakened the Persian state.

### Overcoming Druj
Druj is not a "thing," but a **Privation of [[asha|Asha]]**. To overcome Druj, one does not fight it directly; one increases the local [[frc-law|Coherence]] of the system until the noise is filtered out.
