# Appendices: Ammunition (Falsifiable Core)

![Appendices](/images/chapters/appendices.png)

<div class="voice-kasra">

### Appendix A: Formal Core (Mathematical Architecture)

The Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC) foundation rests on a new conservation law:

**1. The Mother Equation (Reciprocity Law):**
$$ dS + k_* d\ln C = 0 $$
Any increase in local coherence (order) must be paid for by a proportional increase in environmental entropy (chaos).

**2. Adaptive Resonance Operator (ARO):**
$$ \Psi(t + dt) = \hat{O}_{ARF} \cdot \Psi(t) $$
This operator selects the path that maximizes the total system coherence at every time step.

**3. The μ-Stack (Scalar Geometry):**
$$ C_{\text{global}} = \prod_{\mu=0}^{n} C_\mu $$
Coherence at one level is inextricably tied to levels below and above.

### Appendix B: Experimental Files (Falsifiability)

FRC is a scientific theory because it makes predictions that can be proven wrong:

**1. Born Rule Deviation Test:** External resonant fields should systematically bias quantum probabilities.
**2. k_* Slope Measurement:** The relationship between metabolic heat and cellular coherence in living systems must follow a constant linear slope.
**3. RIF Field Identification:** High-resonance human networks should show informational entropy reduction beyond standard data exchange.

These appendices are the ammunition designed to prove the Fortress's validity in the world of science.
