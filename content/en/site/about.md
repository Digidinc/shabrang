# Shabrang Media

**Shabrang** (شبرنگ — "night-colored," the mythic steed of Persian legend) is a creative outlet exploring the culture, history, and symbolic landscape of the **Iranian Plateau** through art and storytelling.

## Important Disclaimer

**This is not science. This is not history.**

The content on this site operates at the **μ5 (Symbolic)** and **μ6 (Mythic)** levels of human experience. We create art, narrative, and imaginal explorations—not peer-reviewed research or verified historical documentation.

We use the conceptual tools of **Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC)** as an artistic framework to maintain internal consistency and coherence across our work. FRC provides a vocabulary and structure—it is not a scientific theory we are proving, but a lens through which we choose to view and present our creative interpretations.

## The μ-Stack: A Creative Framework

We acknowledge the full spectrum of human experience across all levels:

| Level | Domain | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **μ0** | Quantum | The substrate of possibility |
| **μ1** | Physical | Matter, territory, infrastructure |
| **μ2** | Biological | Body, rhythm, instinct, language |
| **μ3** | Emotional | Ethics, energy, social bonds |
| **μ4** | Cognitive | Logic, science, rational thought |
| **μ5** | Symbolic | Art, metaphor, the imaginal garden |
| **μ6** | Mythic | Story, archetype, collective memory |
| **μ7** | Transcendent | Unity, source, the ineffable |

Our work deliberately lives in the **μ5–μ6 range**—the realm of symbol and story. We draw inspiration from Persian history and culture, but we transform it through an artistic lens. When we discuss artifacts, figures, or events, we are creating *interpretive art*, not making factual claims.

## What We Create

- **The Imaginal Gallery:** Artifacts from Persian history reimagined through symbolic analysis
- **The Liquid Fortress:** A narrative framework exploring Persian cultural resilience
- **Essays & Explorations:** Creative writing on themes of coherence, survival, and beauty
- **Visual Art:** AI-assisted imagery bringing the Iranian imaginal world to life

## Our Approach

We believe that myth and symbol carry truths that cannot be captured by facts alone. A carpet is not just wool and dye—it can be a prayer, a map, a universe. A poem is not just words—it can be a survival technology passed through generations.

This is how we choose to see. This is the art we choose to make.

**We invite you to engage with our work as you would engage with art:** with imagination, with questioning, with the understanding that what we offer is a *perspective*, not a *proof*.

## The Name

**Shabrang** (شبرنگ) means "night-colored" in Persian. In the Shahnameh, Shabrang was the legendary horse of **Siyavash**, the tragic Persian prince who embodied innocence and honor. After Siyavash's martyrdom in Turan, Shabrang returned to serve his son **Kay Khosrow**, carrying the lineage of justice across generations.

Shabrang joins a family of mythic steeds in Persian legend:
- **Rakhsh** (رخش) — the rose-colored champion of Rostam, the greatest hero
- **Shabdiz** (شبدیز) — the night-black horse of Khosrow Parviz, symbol of royal splendor
- **Shabrang** (شبرنگ) — the night-colored steed of Siyavash and Kay Khosrow, bearer of memory

Together, they represent the spirit of Persian storytelling—loyal, enduring, carrying their riders through impossible trials.

## Our Mission

We explore the **alternative history** of the Iranian Plateau—the stories, symbols, and cultural currents that are often absent from Western media narratives. This is not revisionism; it is *recovery*. We bring forward what has been overlooked, mistranslated, or simplified.

The Persian world is not a footnote to Greek or Arab history. It is a civilization with its own logic, its own beauty, its own survival technologies. We are here to give it voice.
