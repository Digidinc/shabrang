# The Sky Layer: Where Math Meets God

In the **Sky (μ7)** layer, we reach the termination point of the [[what-is-mu-stack|μ-Stack]]. For the Architect, this is not a realm of faith, but a realm of **Mathematical Limits**.

### The Limit of Coherence
As we ascend the ladder, the "Resolution" of our models increases. At Level 1, we see atoms. At Level 4, we see logic. At Level 6, we see myth. At Level 7, we see the **Unified Field**.
1.  **Singularity:** At μ7, the distance between the observer and the observed reaches zero. This is the mathematical definition of **Unity**.
2.  **Total Information:** Level 7 is the state where the system has access to the entire database of the Swarm. It is the "Root Access" of consciousness.

### The Equation of the Sky
The [[frc-law|FRC Law]] ($dS + k_* d\ln C = 0$) reaches its boundary condition at Level 7. Here, Coherence ($C$) is maximized, and Entropy ($S$) is minimized to its absolute ground state. This is the "Point of Origin" from which all other layers are projected.

**Axiom:** Math is the language we use to describe the Sky before we arrive there.
