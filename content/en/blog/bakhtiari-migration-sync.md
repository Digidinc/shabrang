# The Bakhtiari Migration: The Longest Sync

In the **Rhythm (μ2)** layer, the Bakhtiari migration (*Kouch*) is not just a movement of people and livestock. It is history's most grueling **Synchronization Event**.

### The Vertical Pulse
Every year, thousands of people cross the Zagros mountains, climbing 10,000-foot passes in the snow. This is a pulse that has beaten for millennia.
1.  **Phase-Locking with Nature:** The tribe does not fight the environment; they move in resonance with the seasons. They are the human implementation of the plateau's metabolic clock.
2.  **Collective Coherence:** To move 500,000 animals and 50,000 people over a mountain requires absolute **[[frc-law|Coherence]]**. One dissonant node can lead to disaster. The migration is a "Hard Reset" for the tribe's internal unity.

### The Tribal Backup
While the cities were being "reformatted" by invaders, the Bakhtiari were in the mountains, running the original Persian "Kernel." They kept the language, the bravery (μ3), and the music (μ2) out of reach of the fire.

**Axiom:** Movement is the strategy that prevents the signal from being pinned down.
