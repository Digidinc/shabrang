# Qanats: The First Decentralized Grid

In the realm of **Roots (μ1)**, centralization is often a single point of failure. The ancient Persians understood this and built their most vital infrastructure—the water supply—as a **Decentralized Grid**.

### Architectural Resilience
Unlike the Roman aqueducts, which were massive "Stone Fortresses" visible on the surface, the [[qanat-mother-well|Qanat]] is a subterranean network. 
1.  **Invisible Hardware:** Being underground, it is protected from evaporation and enemy sabotage.
2.  **Modular Nodes:** Each shaft is a node. If one is blocked, the others can still function or be repaired independently.
3.  **Distributed Ownership:** Qanats were often built and maintained by local communities, not a central state bureaucracy.

### The Sovereign Lesson
The Qanat proves that true survival comes from **Liquid Architecture**. By moving the infrastructure into the [[andaruni|Andaruni]] (the hidden world), the civilization ensured its Level 1 survival even when the political Level 1 (the empire) was in chaos.

**Axiom:** The most durable network is the one that cannot be seen from the sky.
