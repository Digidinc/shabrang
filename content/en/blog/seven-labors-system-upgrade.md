# The Seven Labors: A System Upgrade Protocol

In the **Story (μ6)** layer, the myth of **Rostam’s Seven Labors** (*Haft Khan*) is more than an adventure. It is a **System Upgrade Protocol**.

### The Knight's Regression Test
Rostam, the [[rostam-relief-archetype|Guardian Node]], must travel from Sistan to Mazandaran to rescue the King. Along the way, he faces seven challenges. Each "Khan" is a test of a specific layer of the [[mu-stack|μ-Stack]]:
1.  **External Threat (The Lion):** Level 1 Roots.
2.  **Resource Scarcity (The Desert):** Level 1 Maintenance.
3.  **Invisibility (The Dragon):** Level 4 Awareness.
4.  **Deception (The Witch):** Level 5 Signal Processing.
5.  **Direct Combat (Oulad):** Level 3 Courage.
6.  **The Guardian (Arzhang):** Level 6 Narrative Authority.
7.  **The Source of Noise (The White Demon):** Level 7 Metaphysical Purge.

### Upgrading the Field
By surviving the Seven Labors, Rostam doesn't just "Win"; he **Updates** the collective field. He proves that the Persian software can handle any level of entropic noise. After the 7th Khan, the system is fully re-synchronized with the Sky.

**Axiom:** You only reach the Sky after you have mastered the Labors of the Earth.
