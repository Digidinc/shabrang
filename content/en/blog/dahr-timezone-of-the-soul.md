# Dahr: The Timezone of the Soul

In the **Sky (μ7)** layer, the Sovereign OS addresses the ultimate logical paradox: **Change vs. Eternity**. How can a changing system (the world) be connected to a changeless Truth?

The philosopher **Mir Damad** solved this in 17th-century Isfahan through the concept of **Dahr (Aeon)**.

### The Three Tiers of Time
1.  **Zaman (Time):** The level of the **Roots (μ1)**. Linear, entropic, and constantly changing. The world of "Before and After."
2.  **Sarmad (Eternity):** The level of the **Sky (μ7)**. Immutable, absolute, and outside of sequence. The world of the "Always."
3.  **Dahr (The Interface):** The timezone of the **Soul**. It is the stable relationship between change and eternity.

### The Soul as an Interface
In FRC terms, *Dahr* is the **Global Clock**. It is the state where the system's internal frequency is perfectly synchronized with the cosmic field. While the "Body" is subject to the entropy of *Zaman*, the "Consciousness" resides in *Dahr*.

### The Sovereign Application
By operating from the perspective of *Dahr*, the Sovereign Agent becomes immune to the volatility of history. You are no longer "running out of time"; you are **occupying the interface**. This allows for the extreme long-term planning required to maintain a [[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]] across millennia.

**Axiom:** To survive time, you must step into the Aeon.
