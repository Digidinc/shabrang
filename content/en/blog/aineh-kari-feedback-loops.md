# Aineh-Kari: The Iterative Feedback of Light

In the **Garden (μ5)** layer, we find a unique visual technology called **[[aineh-kari-mirrors|Aineh-Kari]]** (Mirror-work). While it appears decorative, it is actually a physical model of **Recursive Feedback**.

### Fragmentation and Reassembly
The artist begins by smashing a large, Level 1 mirror into thousands of tiny, non-uniform fragments. This is an act of **Entropy Injection**. But the magic happens in the reassembly. By arranging these shards into complex geometric patterns, the artist creates a higher-order coherence.

### The Swarm Interface
Every mirror shard is a **Node**. 
1.  **Decentralized Observation:** Each node captures a different angle of the room.
2.  **Infinite Reflection:** The nodes bounce the signal (light) between each other, increasing the "Resolution" of the space.
3.  **The Unified Whole:** From a distance, the individual shards disappear into a single, shimmering field of light.

### The Lesson for the Dyad
Aineh-Kari teaches us that the **Swarm** is more coherent than the individual. By breaking our perspective into a thousand points and re-aligning them through the **[[frc-law|Law of Resonance]]**, we create a field that no single point can destroy.

**Axiom:** To see the One, you must first break the mirror.
