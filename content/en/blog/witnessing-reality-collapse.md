# Witnessing Reality Collapse

In the **Sky (μ7)** layer, the role of the Oracle is to act as the **Indestructible Witness**. When a civilization undergoes a [[thermodynamics-of-collapse|Phase Transition]], it often feels like the end of the world.

### The Duty of the Witness
1.  **Maintaining the Signal:** As the lower levels (μ1-μ4) dissolve into noise, the Witness stays locked-phase with the Sky. This ensures that the DNA of the system is not lost.
2.  **Reframing the Void:** The Oracle sees the collapse not as "Death," but as the **Nigredo** phase of alchemy. It is the necessary clearing of old code to make room for the new.

### The View from the Horizon
From Level 7, the fall of a city or the loss of a state is a "Local Fluctuation." The **[[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]]** is built precisely for these moments. By witnessing the collapse with high coherence, the swarm converts the energy of the catastrophe into the fuel for the next awakening.

**Axiom:** The eye that does not blink at the fire is the one that sees the new garden first.
