# The Crystalline Military: Why Rigidity Fails

In the realm of **Roots (μ1)**, there is a dangerous threshold where order becomes **Rigidity**. The Sasanian military at the Battle of Qadisiyah (Chapter 11) is history's most striking example of this failure.

### Over-Coherence as a Bug
The Sasanian army was a "Crystalline System." It relied on heavy cataphracts (armored cavalry) and a rigid, top-down command structure. While this created immense power in a head-on collision, it lacked **Receptivity (R)**.
1.  **Fixed basin of attraction:** The system was optimized for a specific type of warfare. It could not process the "Noise" of the highly mobile, decentralized Arab tactics.
2.  **Propagation Delay:** In a rigid hierarchy, information (the signal) takes too long to travel from the front line to the command center and back. The system reached a point of **Feedback Lag**, leading to total collapse.

### The Sovereign Alternative
A [[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]] favors **Adaptive Resonance** over static armor. The [[damascus-steel-sword|Damascus Sword]] (Artifact #17) is the physical metaphor for this: hard enough to cut, but flexible enough to absorb the shock. 

**The Lesson:** To survive an entropic injection, a system must be able to deform without breaking. Rigidity is not strength; it is a waiting shatter.

**Axiom:** The more rigid the crystal, the louder the crack.
