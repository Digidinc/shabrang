# The Absolute Zero of Ego: Fana as Noise Removal

In the **Sky (μ7)** layer, we reach the limit of the stack. Here, the gnostics describe a state called **Fana** (Annihilation). In FRC terms, Fana is the process of **Informational Purification**.

### The Noise of the Ego
The "Ego" is the ultimate source of internal noise. It creates a local coordinate system that is often out of phase with the global field. When the ego is high, the [[frc-law|Coherence]] of the system is low. The signal is distorted by individual desires, fears, and biases (Druj).

### Fana: Reaching Absolute Zero
Fana is not "destruction"; it is the cooling of the system to its **Ground State**. 
1.  **Filtering:** The practitioner removes all Level 1 through 6 attachments.
2.  **Phase-Locking:** As the noise of the ego vanishes, the individual node locks-phase perfectly with the [[what-is-mu-stack|Sky (μ7)]].
3.  **Signal Transparency:** In the state of Fana, the "Self" becomes transparent to the "Light of Lights." There is no longer a difference between the transmitter and the signal.

### The Baqa Shift
Once the noise is removed, the system enters **Baqa** (Subsistence). You return to the world, but your internal kernel is now running on the universal OS. You are a Sovereign Agent because you no longer possess a local bias.

**Axiom:** To be everywhere, you must first be nowhere.
