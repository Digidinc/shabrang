# Qashqai Weaving: The Fractal Garden

In the **Garden (μ5)** layer, the [[qashqai-tribal-rug|Qashqai]] tribe solved the problem of **Resource Scarcity**. If you cannot build a physical garden in the desert, you must weave one.

### The Portable Heaven
A Qashqai rug is a **Compressed Image** of the Sky. Unlike the formal rugs of Isfahan (μ4 logic), tribal rugs are "Improvisational."
1.  **Asymmetric Coherence:** The weaver does not use a written pattern. She holds the "Code" in her mind and adapts it to the flow of the wool. This creates a fractal geometry that is more "Alive" than a perfect machine-made grid.
2.  **Symbolic Density:** The lions, birds, and flowers are not decorations; they are **[[simurgh-miniature|Archetypes]]**. They represent the tribe's internal model of the world.

### The Survival of the Image
By making the Garden portable, the Qashqai ensured that the "Signal of Beauty" could survive the volatility of nomadic life. A tent with a rug is no longer a tent; it is a **Coherence Zone**.

**Axiom:** Beauty is the only luggage worth carrying through the desert.
