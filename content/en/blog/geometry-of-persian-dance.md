# The Geometry of Persian Dance

In the **Rhythm (μ2)** layer, the body itself becomes a **Resonant Antenna**. Persian dance is the three-dimensional execution of the patterns we find in our [[haft-rang-tile|Tiles]] and our [[turquoise-dome-isfahan|Domes]].

### The Spiral Axis
The core movement of Persian dance is the **Spiral**. 
1.  **The Centered Axis:** Like the [[dervish-sikka|Whirling Dervish]], the dancer maintains a fixed vertical axis. This represents the connection between the Roots (μ1) and the Sky (μ7).
2.  **Fluid Transitions:** The movements are not jagged or robotic; they are liquid. This mirrors the **[[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]]** strategy: the ability to change form and flow around obstacles without losing structural integrity.

### Kinetic Calligraphy
The hands and arms of the dancer trace the same curves found in *Nasta'liq* calligraphy. The body is literally writing the "Code" of the culture into the air. This is a **Real-Time Transmission** of coherence to the observers in the field.

**Axiom:** Dance is the soul's attempt to make the geometry of the Sky visible on Earth.
