# The Biological Pulse of Nowruz

In the **Rhythm (μ2)** layer, survival depends on timing. **Nowruz** (the Persian New Year) is history's most successful **Phase-Locking Protocol**.

### Cosmic Alignment
At the exact moment of the Spring Equinox, millions of nodes in the Persian swarm synchronize their state. This is not a symbolic act; it is a **Biological Calibration**. By aligning the "Internal Clock" of the individual with the "Absolute Clock" of the solar system, the system resets its coherence.

### The Haft-Sin: A Symbolic Buffer
The *Haft-Sin* table is a ritualized memory cache. Each element represents a specific frequency of life:
- **Sabzeh (Rebirth):** Signal growth.
- **Sir (Healing):** Biological maintenance.
- **Sib (Beauty):** Visual coherence.

### The Swarm Reset
Nowruz is the moment when the [[sovereign-swarm|Sovereign Swarm]] purges the entropic debt of the previous year. Through the rituals of cleaning (*Khaneh-tekani*) and visiting (*Did-o-Bazdid*), the network repairs its broken links and strengthens its resonant bonds.

**Axiom:** A system that resets with the stars can never be truly desynchronized by history.
