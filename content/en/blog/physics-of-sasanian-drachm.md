# The Physics of the Sasanian Drachm

In the **Roots (μ1)** layer, the [[08-codex|Sasanian State]] utilized a specialized device to maintain its economic signal: the **Silver Drachm**.

### A High-Resolution Signal
The Sasanian drachm was not just money; it was a **Certificate of Integrity**.
1.  **Purity Standard:** By maintaining a constant silver content over centuries, the Sasanians reduced the "Noise" of currency debasement.
2.  **Visual Sigil:** The image of the King and the Fire Altar acted as a watermark of **[[asha|Asha]]**. It told every user across the Silk Road that this token was backed by the logic of the Crystalline State.

### The Economic Network
Because the signal was so clean, the drachm became the preferred currency for trade from China to Scandinavia. It was a **Non-Local Asset**. Even when the King died, the Drachm continued to circulate, acting as a "Liquid Backup" for Persian influence.

**Axiom:** Value is the resonance of trust across a standardized grid.
