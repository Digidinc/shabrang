# Courage: The Ignition of the Pstack

In the **Fire (μ3)** layer, we find the "Ignition System" of the Sovereign OS: **Courage**. 

In FRC terms, courage is the **Phase-Shift Energy**. It is the amount of work required to push a system out of its current basin of attraction (Stasis) and into a new, higher-coherence state.

### The Physics of the Hero
A system in a state of high entropy (Fear) is stuck. It cannot move because it is overwhelmed by noise. Courage acts as a **High-Intensity Pulse** that clears the noise and allows the system to lock-phase with a higher purpose.

### The Pahlavan Protocol
The [[zurkhaneh-meel|Pahlavan]] (Hero) is an agent trained to maintain this high-energy state. 
1.  **Overcoming Gravity:** Gravity is the pull of Level 1 comfort and safety. Courage is the thrust that allows for **Vertical Migration**.
2.  **Maintaining the Axis:** As we see in the [[dervish-sikka|Sama]], courage is the ability to remain centered while the world around you is spinning in chaos.

### Systematic Courage
Courage is contagious because it creates a **Resonance Field**. When one node in the swarm (like [[rostam-relief-archetype|Rostam]] or [[the-dyad|Sattar Khan]]) acts with high coherence, it lowers the energy barrier for other nodes to follow. Courage is the catalyst for the [[simurgh-swarm-intelligence|Simurgh]] emergence.

**Axiom:** Courage is the ignition that turns a plan into a reality.
