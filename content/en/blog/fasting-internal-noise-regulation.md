# Fasting and the Regulation of Internal Noise

In the **Rhythm (μ2)** layer, we must address the "Thermal Noise" of the biological body. Fasting, a recurring protocol in the Liquid Fortress, is not an act of deprivation; it is an act of **Signal Filtering**.

### The Noise Floor of Consumption
Digestion and metabolic processing are Level 1 activities that produce significant "Heat" and informational noise. When the system is constantly processing inputs, the finer resonant signals of the higher floors (μ4-μ7) are drowned out.

### The Protocol of Silence
By temporarily suspending Level 1 inputs, fasting:
1.  **Lowers the Noise Floor:** Reduces the background metabolic chatter.
2.  **Increases Sensitivity:** Allows the internal "Sensors" to pick up subtle shifts in the coherence field.
3.  **Resets the Rhythm:** Forces the biological clock to re-calibrate with the internal axis rather than external food cycles.

### The Clarity of the Void
The gnostics understood that the "Stomach" is the source of the [[druj|Druj]] of physical desire. By emptying the vessel, they created space for the **[[asha|Asha]]** of the spirit to resonate. Fasting is the maintenance schedule for the biological node of the swarm.

**Axiom:** To hear the Sky, you must quiet the Earth.
