# Modern Concrete vs. Ancient Stone

In the **Roots (μ1)** layer, we must choose the materials for our fortress. The [[28-modernity-shock|Shock of Modernity]] introduced "Grey Concrete" to the Persian plateau, but it came with a hidden entropic debt.

### The Problem with Concrete
Modern reinforced concrete has a lifespan of 50 to 100 years. The internal steel rebar eventually rusts, expanding and cracking the material from within. It is a system designed for **Short-Term High-Intensity Coherence**, but it cannot survive the "Deep Time" of history.

### The Wisdom of Stone
In contrast, the masonry of [[gate-of-all-nations|Persepolis]] and the brickwork of [[taq-kasra-arch|Taq Kasra]] have stood for millennia.
1.  **Material Integration:** They use materials that are in resonance with the local environment.
2.  **Structural Honesty:** They rely on geometry (arches, vaults) rather than internal tension.

### The Sovereign Choice
To build a true [[liquid-fortress|Liquid Fortress]], we must select technologies that possess **Long-Term Signal Stability**. We use the tools of the modern age (μ4 logic), but we anchor them in the durable roots of ancient wisdom.

**Axiom:** True power is measured by the duration of the signal, not the hardness of the shell.
