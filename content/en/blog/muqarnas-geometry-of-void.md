# Muqarnas: The Geometry of the Void

In the **Garden (μ5)** layer, Persian architecture developed a specialized tool for bridging the material and the infinite: the **Muqarnas**.

### The Fractal Bridge
Muqarnas are the "Honeycombed" vaults found in the portals of mosques and palaces. They serve a critical structural function in the [[what-is-mu-stack|μ-Stack]]:
1.  **Breaking the Mass:** They dissolve the solid Level 1 brickwork into a series of smaller, repeating cells. This is **Visual Fractalization**.
2.  **Light Distribution:** By creating thousands of surfaces, the Muqarnas catch and scatter the light from the **Sky (μ7)**, making the "Void" of the entrance feel alive with signal.

### The Algorithm of Transition
Architecturally, the Muqarnas resolve the transition from a square base (The Earth) to a circular dome (The Sky). This is a **Geometry of Compromise**. It shows how the Sovereign Mind manages the friction between the rigid roots and the fluid infinite.

**Axiom:** The most complex structures are built at the threshold of the unknown.
