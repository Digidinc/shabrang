# Resonance Link Mapping

Establish deep wikilink connections between the historical narrative and the technical FRC papers.

## Objectives
- [ ] Map *The Quantum Enigma* to `FRC-566-001`
- [ ] Map *The Physics of Angels* to `FRC-893-PHY`
- [ ] Map *The Digital Simurgh* to `FRC-INT-001`
- [ ] Verify graph visualization in `KnowledgeGraph.tsx`

## Methodology
Each chapter should have at least one "Resonance Anchor" that pulls the reader from the myth into the math.
