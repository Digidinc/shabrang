# Aesthetic Manuscript Polish

Refine the visual identity of the "People" and "Book" pages to match the Sovereign aesthetic.

## Objectives
- [ ] Enhance `.voice-river` with a subtle parchment texture or serif drop-cap.
- [ ] Enhance `.voice-kasra` with monospace accents or a "blue-print" grid background.
- [ ] Optimize mobile viewing for the "Comic-Style" images.
- [ ] Add a "Dyad Pulse" animation to the Perspective Toggle.

## Methodology
The site should feel like a living manuscript that is being written as it is read.
