# Knowledge Graph Optimization

Strengthen the connective tissue of the Sovereign OS by ensuring every node has high centrality.

## Objectives
- [ ] Audit all 30 Book Chapters for missing [[concepts|Concept]] links.
- [ ] Cross-link all 26 Artifacts to the relevant Blog posts.
- [ ] Update `next.config.ts` or metadata headers to ensure proper canonical URL handling for the `shabrang.com` transition.
- [ ] Verify that the Knowledge Graph in the UI reflects the new density.

## Methodology
Every "Artifact" should be a doorway to a "Logic" and a "Story".
