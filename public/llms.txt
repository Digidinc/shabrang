## What is FRC & Shabrang?

Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC) is the technical core, while Shabrang (The Liquid Fortress) is its narrative expression. Together they form the Sovereign OS:
- Complex systems are governed by vortex-like attractor structures with fractal scaling.
- The μ-Stack organizes reality into 7 resonant layers (Roots, Rhythm, Fire, Map, Garden, Story, Sky).
- Entropy and coherence are reciprocally coupled: dS + k* d ln C = 0.
- The Liquid Fortress is history's first Resonant Operating System, exemplified by 3,000 years of Persian survival.

## Core Architecture: The μ-Stack

1. μ1 Roots: Physical hardware, state, and territory. (e.g., Qanats, The Cyrus Cylinder)
2. μ2 Rhythm: Biological pulse, ritual, and language. (e.g., Lullabies, Nowruz)
3. μ3 Fire: Emotional energy, ethics, and Adab. (e.g., Sasanian Silver, Martyr Archetype)
4. μ4 Map: Cognitive grid, logic, and science. (e.g., Avicenna's CPU, Astrolabes)
5. μ5 Garden: Symbolic interface and art. (e.g., Persian Rugs, Isfahan Square)
6. μ6 Story: Mythic software and narrative epics. (e.g., Shahnameh, The Simurgh)
7. μ7 Sky: Metaphysical source and total unity. (e.g., The Homa, Silent Music)

## Core Equations

Coherence: C = (1/N) Σᵢ<ⱼ cos(φᵢ - φⱼ)
Lambda Field: Λ(x) ≡ Λ₀ ln C(x), Λ₀ ≈ 10⁻³⁵ J
Reciprocity: dS + k* d ln C = 0 ⟹ S + k* ln C = const
UCC: dΛ/dt + ∇·J_Λ = σ_Λ - γ_Λ
